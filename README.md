# ComfyUI integration in Krita

## WIP: Scope of the project
### Krita
- [x] The only required dependency for the user is to have a ComfyUI server open and accessible
- [ ] ComfyUI's UI must be integrated in a docker
- [x] As little patching and highjacking as realistically possible on top of ComfyUI
- [ ] ComfyUI live previews work when running a workow from Krita
- [ ] Dynamic workflow inputs that are parsed from the selected ComfyUI workflow
- [ ] Custom "layer-set selector" component to select the set of layers to composite before sending to ComfyUI

### ComfyUI
Custom nodes are used for interacting with Krita:
- [ ] `KritaLayerSet` node: select which layers to composite in Krita before sending as an image to ComfyUI
- [ ] `KritaActiveSelection` node: get the active selection mask
- [ ] `KritaCreateLayer` node: send the image back to Krita to a given location in the layer tree

## Why another krita plugin? 
All the existing plugins that attempt to integrate ComfyUI in Krita do both too much and too little.  

An idiomatic plugin:
- Does not require dependencies that can be made optional
- Does not take away features that were granted in either Krita or ComfyUI
